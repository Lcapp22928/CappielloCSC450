# Enhancing Education in Computer Science: Evaluation of AI-Assisted Code Generation and Explination

The objective of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of AI tools such as ChatGPT as an assistive educational tool for beginner computer science concepts. This study aims to measure participants percived compuational thinking and learning outcomes. 

Over the past decade, advancements in AI have revolutionized various industries, including education. These advancements in AI technology, particularly in natural language processing and machine learning have enabled the development of intelligent tutoring systems and code generation tools that can provide personalized assistance to students. AI has become such a powerful tool in programming through its ability to “employ advanced machine learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques to suggest code snippets, autocomplete syntax, and provide contextual guidance” [4]. This research aims to explore the impact that the use of AI has as an educational compliment to traditional teaching methods. This will be measured by perceived impact from participant experience on their confidence in computational thinking and programming skills as well as self-confidence.
